    "# Cereal Cleaner\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will create an application that reads in cereal data from a CSV file and then prints only those cereals that contain 5 or more grams of fiber.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Open the file, `cereal.csv` and start by skipping the header row. See hints below for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Read through the remaining rows and find the cereals that contain five grams of fiber or more, printing the data from those rows to the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every value within the csv is stored as a string, and certain values have a decimal. This means that they will have to be cast to be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `csv.reader` begins reading the CSV file from the first row. `next(csv_reader, None)` will skip the header row.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Refer to this Stack Overflow post on [how to skip the header](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14257599) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Integers in Python are whole numbers and, as such, cannot contain decimals. Decimal numbers As such, your numbers containing decimal points will have to be cast as a `float`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bonus\n",
    "\n",
    "Try the activity again, but this time use `cereal_bonus.csv`, which does not include a header.\n",
    "\n",
